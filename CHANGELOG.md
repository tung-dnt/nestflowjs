### Changed
- Version bump to 0.1.0

## [0.0.8] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Durable Lambda Adapter** — `DurableLambdaEventHandler` for AWS Lambda Durable Functions (checkpoint/replay execution model)
  - `IDurableContext` interface abstracting the AWS SDK (no compile-time dependency)
  - `WithDurableExecution` type for injecting the SDK wrapper
  - Idle states pause via `ctx.waitForCallback()`, final states end execution
  - Ambiguous auto-transitions handled via `ctx.waitForCallback()` for explicit event resolution
- **`TransitResult` return type** from `OrchestratorService.transit()` — `final`, `idle`, `continued` (with `nextEvent`), `no_transition`
- `IWorkflowEvent` interface moved to `@/core` (previously in `@/event-bus`)
- Comprehensive E2E tests at Lambda handler level using `MockDurableContext`
- `MockDurableContext` test fixture with `waitUntilCallbackRegistered()` for reliable async coordination
- ESLint configuration (migrated from TSLint)

### Changed
- **Orchestrator is now adapter-agnostic** — `transit()` returns data, adapters decide how to handle progression (publish to SQS, Kafka, checkpoint, etc.)
- `brokerPublisher` removed from `OrchestratorService` — no longer resolves or calls broker internally
- `brokerPublisher` field removed from `IWorkflowDefinition` and `IWorkflowDefaultRoute`
- `WorkflowModule.register()` no longer accepts `brokers` parameter
- `findValidTransition()` refactored — single-pass loop with `matchesState()`/`matchesEvent()` helpers, returns `{ transition, hasEventStateMatch }` (eliminates duplicate event+state scan)
- `IWorkflowEvent.topic` field renamed to `IWorkflowEvent.event`
- Formatting migrated from Prettier/TSLint to Biome

### Removed
- **`packages/event-bus/`** — entire package removed (`IBrokerPublisher`, `SqsEmitter`, `IWorkflowEvent`)
- **`packages/adapter/lambda.adapter.ts`** — SQS-based Lambda adapter (replaced by durable adapter)
- Saga service (`packages/core/providers/saga.service.ts` and `packages/core/types/saga.interface.ts`)
- `brokers` provider registration from `WorkflowModule`
- Broker-related test fixtures (`MockBrokerService`) and assertions (`assertBrokerEvent`)
- GitHub publish workflow
